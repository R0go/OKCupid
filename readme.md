# OK Cupid - The Zodiac Sign Project
## Project goal
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset of dating profiles and build a machine learning model predicting the person's zodiac sign based on other available information. The dataset required extensive cleaning up before creating the models. Three different models were tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors. However, ultimately, the models did not perform better on the test set than random guessing.</br>
