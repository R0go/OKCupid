This is due to providing a combination of answers, e.g. mixed ethnicities and languages, commenting on your zodiac sign etc. Also, the location has 199 unique values, which is not surprising, however it can be reduced to include just the country/state instead of the exact city. These values need to be generalized in order to make them valuable for data modeling."
